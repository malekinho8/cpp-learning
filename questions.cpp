// What is the difference between the -> and :: in C++? --> The -> operator is used to access a member of a pointer to an object. The :: operator is used to access a member of a class, structure, or union.

// In C++, a member of a pointer is basically just a member of the object that the pointer points to. For example, if we have a pointer to an object called "object", and we want to access a member of that object called "member", we can do that by using the -> operator. If we have a class called "class", and we want to access a member of that class called "member", we can do that by using the :: operator.

// In Python, we can access a member of an object by using the . operator. For example, if we have an object called "object", and we want to access a member of that object called "member", we can do that by using the . operator. If we have a class called "class", and we want to access a member of that class called "member", we can do that by using the . operator.

// In C++, the difference between a class and an object is that a class is a type, and an object is an instance of that type. A "type" is a set of values, and an "instance" is a value of that type. For example, if we have a class called "class", and we want to create an object of that class called "object", we can do that by using the new operator. If we have a class called "class", and we want to create an object of that class called "object", we can do that by using the new operator.

// Question: Would that mean that "object" points to "class"? --> Yes, that is correct. "object" points to "class".

// Since "object" points to "class", we can access a member of "class" by using the -> operator. For example, if we have a class called "class", and we want to access a member of that class called "member", we can do that by using the -> operator.

// A simple example demonstrating the difference between the -> and :: operators in C++:

#include <iostream>

class Class{
    public:
        int member;
};

int main(){
    Class* object = new Class(); // what does this line do? --> It creates a new object of type Class and assigns it to the pointer object. What does the * do? --> The * is used to declare a pointer. What is a pointer? --> A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. What is the difference between a pointer and a variable? --> A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. A variable is a name that refers to a value.

    // Next, we assign a value to the member variable of the object.
    object->member = 1; // what does this line do? --> It assigns the value 1 to the member variable of the object. What does the -> do? --> The -> is used to access a member of a pointer to an object. What is a member? --> A member is a variable that is part of a class or structure.

    // Next, we print the value of the member variable of the object.
    std::cout << object->member << std::endl; // what does this line do? --> It prints the value of the member variable of the object. What does the << do? --> The << is used to print a value to the console. What is the console? --> The console is the window where the program is running. What is the difference between the console and the terminal? --> The console is the window where the program is running. The terminal is the window where the program is running. 

    // Why does std::cout use :: and not ->? --> Because std::cout is a class, and not a pointer to an object.
    // Does std::cout have any members that we can point to like we did in the example above? --> Yes, std::cout has a member called "member".
    // Okay, so then we do we say std::cout::member and not std::cout->member? --> Because std::cout is a class, and not a pointer to an object.
    // But in our example above, I guess I am just confused about why we use -> and not ::. --> Because object is a pointer to an object, and not a class.
    // Could we have used :: in our example above? --> Yes, we could have used :: in our example above.
    // Why? --> Because object is a pointer to an object, and not a class.

    // Next, we delete the object.
    delete object; // what does this line do? --> It deletes the object. What does the delete keyword do? --> The delete keyword is used to delete an object. What is an object? --> An object is an instance of a class. What is a class? --> A class is a type. What is a type? --> A type is a set of values. What is an instance? --> An instance is a value of a type. What is a value? --> A value is a number, string, or other data type. Why do we want to delete the object? --> We want to delete the object because we don't want to use it anymore. What happens if we don't delete the object? --> If we don't delete the object, it will stay in memory and take up space.
